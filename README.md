# Share_a_meal

### Description

This is the repository for the share a meal android application. The application is intended for people who want to share meals with others. The application uses an API with which the meals are retrieved and to which new meals can also be sent. Users are also stored there.

### Usage

The app can be run on an android device. Currently the application is built for smartphones (vertical) format and works poorly on, for example, a tablet (horizontal). You can open the app by clicking on the icon like all other android apps. This will take you to a page where all meals can be seen. Here you can scroll through. When clicking on a meal you will see even more information about that meal.
